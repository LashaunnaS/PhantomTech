			<h2>The Need To Know</h2>
			<p>A computer mouse is a pointing device (hand control) that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface. Physically, a mouse consists of an object held in one's hand, with one or more buttons. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and "wheels", which enable additional control and dimensional input.</p>

			<h3>Bonus features</h3>
			<p>Users can also employ mice gesturally; meaning that a stylized motion of the mouse cursor itself, called a <q>gesture</q>, can issue a command or map to a specific action. For example, in a drawing program, moving the mouse in a rapid <q>x</q> motion over a shape might delete the shape.

			Gestural interfaces occur more rarely than plain pointing-and-clicking; and people often find them more difficult to use, because they require finer motor-control from the user. However, a few gestural conventions have become widespread, including the drag and drop gesture, in which:

			The user presses the mouse button while the mouse cursor hovers over an interface object
			The user moves the cursor to a different location while holding the button down
			The user releases the mouse button
			For example, a user might drag-and-drop a picture representing a file onto a picture of a trash can, thus instructing the system to delete the file.</p>
