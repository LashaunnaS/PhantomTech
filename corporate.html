			<h4>What we belive</h4>
			<p>Welcome to the Phantom Tech procurement website. Over the years, Phantom Tech has developed an entire
				ecosystem of suppliers who support our business operations. Our goal, in a nutshell, is to obtain
				stellar products and services within tight timeframes, at a cost that represents the best possible value
				to our customers and shareholders. If that sounds like a daunting task, it’s the same one we assign ourselves.</p>

			<p>We are proud of the strong relationships we have built with our suppliers, many of whom have been working
				with us for years. And we are always looking to expand our supplier base to accommodate our rapidly growing
				customer base. To that end, we periodically review our relationships and add new suppliers as needed.</p>

			<h4>Suppliers at Phantom Tech</h4>

			<p>Phantom Tech requires each of its suppliers to meet the highest standards for all goods and services. Our
				requirements include a commitment to rigorous quality assurance. In addition, suppliers must be committed,
				as we are, to ensuring the highest standards of social responsibility.</p>

			<p>The ideal suppliers are those who understand our culture and expectations. We value suppliers who take
				the time to learn about and understand our business and who look for ways to add value. These suppliers
				know the importance of making and meeting commitments and delivering the highest quality goods and services.</p>

			<p>Our business environment is competitive and fast-paced. Our suppliers must understand this dynamic and be
				agile and flexible in responding to changing business conditions. Above all, Pahntom tech values innovation.
				We appreciate suppliers who truly understand and share in our challenges, and who help us find the best possible
				solutions.</p>

			<h4>Supplier Diversity Program</h4>

			<p>We take our social and environmental responsibilities seriously. A good example is our strong and
				longstanding commitment to a diverse supplier base.</p>

			<p>Phantom Tech's Supplier Diversity Program was formally established in 1993; since that time the company
				has continued growing and supporting the long list of suppliers who participate. Phantom Tech actively
				participates in the program through the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), the Women’s
				Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), and Veteran–Owned Business Expositions, as well as Supplier
				Diversity Business Opportunity Trade Fairs around the country.</p>

			<p>The businesses we categorize as diverse suppliers are Minority-Owned, Women-Owned, Veteran-Owned, and
				Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, as well as businesses located in Historically Underutilized
				Business regions (HUBZone) and Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB).</p>

			<p>So how does a business join Phantom tech's Supplier Diversity Program? That’s simple: You start by registering
				as a prospective supplier. Following a swift verification and screening process to ensure a good fit between
				supplier strengths and capabilities and Phantom Tech's current and future requirements, Phantom Tech reviews
				the supplier information. The business then becomes a potential supplier who may be used in the procurement
				process as business needs dictate. In the interest of encouraging the success of our diverse supplier base,
				we work with the Supplier Diversity Program participants to help them develop their businesses. This often
				involves working with a number of organizations that offer training and feedback.</p>

			<p>Suppliers who wish to participate in Phantom Tech's Supplier Diversity Program should register as a Prospective
				Supplier so their information is available in Phantom Tech's prospective supplier database. We have included
				special areas within the database to alert our supplier diversity team and relevant procurement professionals
				about the availability of qualified participants in Phantom Tech's Supplier Diversity Program. This helps increase
				the visibility of these suppliers and can improve their potential for engagement.</p>

			<h4>Sourcing Process</h4>

			<p>Phantom Tech's sourcing process is designed to ensure equal and fair treatment of suppliers so that they can fully
				participate in a competitive procurement process.</p>

			<p>We ask suppliers wishing to participate in the process to register in Supplier Connect, a secure online
				database that Phantom Tech maintains with regularly updated information on current and potential suppliers.
				Supplier Connect enables Phantom Tech procurement professionals to access key information about potential
				and current suppliers, including capabilities, Supplier Diversity certifications, product/service descriptions,
				Universal Standard Products and Services Classification (UNSPSC) codes, contact information, and so on.</p>

			<h4>The First Step</h4>

			<p>The first step any supplier should take in seeking opportunities to do business with Phantom Tech is to
				register in Supplier Connect. If your company registers in Supplier Connect and there’s a need for the
				type of products or services you provide, a Phantom Tech procurement professional can then contact you
				to explore potential opportunities.</p>

			<p>If there’s no immediate opportunity for engagement (as sometimes happens), the information will remain
				in Phantom Tech's confidential Supplier Information Database for six months or for as long as you
				continue visiting Phantom Tech's procurement website to keep your company’s information up to date.</p>

			<p>Please note that all purchases are made in the competitive marketplace. Registering your company in
				Supplier Connect does not automatically place your company on a “bidder’s list,” nor does it constitute
				approval of your firm as an Phantom Tech supplier or obligate Phantom Tech to solicit requests for quotations.</p>

			<p>Register with Supplier Connect - Two steps are required to register in Supplier Connect. First create a
				My Access account. Once your My Access account is created you will receive a notification to register your company in Supplier Connect.</p>

			<p>Responsible Supplier Management
			Phantom Tech is committed to ensuring the highest standards of social responsibility in everything we do.</p>
